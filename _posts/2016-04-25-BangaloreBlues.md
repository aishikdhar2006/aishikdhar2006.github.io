title: Bangalore Blues
subtitle: For Your Perfect First Week in Bangalore
---

I have googled quite a bit about dinner places to eat out at, cafes to spend your leisurely evenings at, clubs to go to and pubs to visit in Bangalore but I have never found that one perfect blog with all these places listed together. I arrived in Bangalore one fine winter evening three months back. With no such blog to get help from, I stumbled and stumbled and in the process discovered Bangalore. To relieve newcomers in the city of this impossible decision making burden, I will try to set the itinerary for the first one week. I will list down the starters to order, the drinks to get high on and the seats to take. Hope this blog helps.

Cafes:

1. Matteo Coffea: Most good cafes are present in Koramangala. Very few in Indiranagar. But there are still a few good ones there. And one of them is Matteo Coffea! If you are looking to spend the perfect weekday evening at a cafe, reading your favourite book with good soft music in the background to soothe your senses, this is certainly the place to be. You are new to Bangalore. And Bangalore is known for its insane weather. So you need to spend time out in the open and enjoy the cool breeze. And this place lets you do exactly that. This place has outside seating area and inside too. I say you be seated outside. Be ready for slow service. But you have plenty of time so that shouldn't deter you! 
Don't Miss: If you like cheesecake, you just can't give their Blueberry Cheesecake a miss! One of the best I have had in Bangalore till now!
Be Seated: Outside please!

2. Glen's Bakehouse: A cute little place located just beside it's bigger, more famous big brother Toit, this place makes extremely tasty pastries which will not disappoint you! You will keep coming back for more! Order cheescake and Lemon Tart for dessert. Be aware though that this place has extremely slow service. If you are looking at home delivery of its desserts then it is fine. They have a small menu with not a lot of variety but if you are going there for the first time, there are enough things to make you go home happy. Order the traditional pesto for pasta. It is delicious. Apparently, it is known for its breakfast. So if you are an early riser and need to have a wholesome breakfast then give its breakfast menu a try!
Don't Miss: The Parmesan Mushroom Soup they serve is best I have had after The Corniche, Mumbai. It is fresh and thick. Won't disappoint!
Be Seated On the outside or just the inside area on the left overlooking the garden.
